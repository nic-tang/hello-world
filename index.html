	<p class="bodyText">I recently found a miniature light/candle holder from 
		<a href="https://www.herbivorebotanicals.com/products/amethyst-crystal-tea-light-holder?_pos=5&_sid=40a8013f3&_ss=r">Herbivore Botanicals</a>. I love that it is made out of one of my favourite crystals; the amethyst. Amethyst is known as a powerhouse purification stone. It helps awakens higher consciousness and facilitates calmness. Not only that, it is pretty to look at.</p>
